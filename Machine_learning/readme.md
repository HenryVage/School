# In this project I have made a program to recognize digits in form of pictures and predict which number it is.

* To achieve this, I have used a machine learning approach which is a very good approach to this problem, since the ultimate goal is a program that can do this task on its own. This is essentially what machine learning is about. Given input and output produce a program. If I were to do the same task using only traditional programming this task would be impossible for me.
* In real life scenario on unseen data the solution would be good I think, certainly with enough training data and computing power/time.
